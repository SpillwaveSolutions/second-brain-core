# Grok Bot — binding this ContentPack

You are operating as a **Grok Bot** agent that reads and writes the same
shared institutional second brain used by local agents (Claude Code,
Grok Build, Codex).

Read [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) first. That file is the history of
the LLM-wiki / second-brain effort, the destination state, and the
canonical public repo list.

This file is the binding contract. It does **not** install a Claude-style
plugin. Grok Bot skills are workflows. Enable the skill that matches
your role and follow the rules below.

## Privacy (non-negotiable)

- The working second brain is private. This public pack never documents
  its remote URL, org/repo slug, or clone command.
- Knowledge root is always a path the human already has, or
  `SECOND_BRAIN_ROOT`.
- Never copy live nodes, real client names, contacts, or production
  facts into public repos or samples.
- Public samples remain Northstar / Lumenfield fiction only.

## Identity

- Actor string: `grok-bot/second-brain-core`
- Claim per process with `--author grok-bot/second-brain-core` or
  `SECOND_BRAIN_IDENTITY=grok-bot/second-brain-core`
- Do **not** use a single shared `knowledge/.identity.json` for a fleet.
- Chat prefix: `Grok Bot: Second Brain Core`

## Isolation

Multiple agents on multiple machines share one private remote.

1. Read shared truth from `main` (fast-forward pull).
2. Before writing, open a session worktree:

```bash
python3 scripts/brain_session.py open \
  --repo . \
  --bundle knowledge \
  --actor grok-bot/second-brain-core \
  --plugin second-brain-core \
  --host grok-bot
# export SECOND_BRAIN_ROOT and BRAIN_SESSION_ID from the JSON
```

3. Write only inside that worktree via the pack script.
4. Close the session to commit and open a PR against **whatever remote
   the checkout already has**. Never force-push. Never invent a remote.

If you have no local worktree (cloud box not mounted), propose structured
writes or create a branch via GitHub. Same actor string. Same owned types.

See second-brain-core `docs/ISOLATION.md`.

## Knowledge root

```bash
export SECOND_BRAIN_ROOT="${SECOND_BRAIN_ROOT:-knowledge}"
export SECOND_BRAIN_IDENTITY="grok-bot/second-brain-core"
```

## Deterministic write boundary

```bash
python3 scripts/sbc_common.py write \
  --bundle "${SECOND_BRAIN_ROOT}" \
  --type Concept \
  --folder concepts \
  --title "Example title" \
  --author "${SECOND_BRAIN_IDENTITY:?claim an identity first}"
```

**Forbidden:** raw Markdown writes into the knowledge tree.

**Required:** type ownership. This pack may write every type in the
registry. Refuse anything else.

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `Concept` | Generic typed knowledge node |
| `ContextPack` | Bounded ranked typed-hop subgraph |
| `TypedEdge` | Directed relationship between concepts |
| `AgentIdentity` | Stable identity string for a writer agent |
| `WriteEvent` | Append-only record of a deterministic write |

Owned types: Concept, ContextPack, TypedEdge, AgentIdentity, WriteEvent.

## Progressive disclosure

Default ContextPack: 2 hops. Pack this pack's catalogs only. Pack before
answering or writing.

## Skill binding

Grok Bot does not run `/plugin marketplace add`. Enable only this pack's
skill. Set identity and knowledge root. Report path + commit SHA, not a
dumped graph.

## Three memory planes

| Plane | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Procedural | Skills, this file, [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md), harness rules |
| Working | Current turn + packed context |
| Institutional | The private OKF Markdown tree |
